# Implementation Documentation

Detailed implementation plans and technical specifications for project features.

## Available Implementation Plans

### Core Features
- **[HIL v1.1 Implementation Plan](./HIL_v1.1_Implementation_Plan.md)** - Human-in-the-Loop feature integration
- **[HIL Frontend Implementation Plan](./HIL_Frontend_Implementation_Plan.md)** - Frontend-specific HIL implementation
- **[Feedback System Implementation Plan](./FEEDBACK_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)** - User feedback system implementation

## Implementation Workflow

1. **Review Plans**: Understand the feature requirements and technical approach
2. **Follow Specifications**: Implement according to the detailed plans
3. **Test Implementation**: Use corresponding testing guides
4. **QA Validation**: Follow QA procedures for validation

## Technical Details

Each implementation plan includes:
- Feature objectives and requirements
- Technical architecture and approach
- Implementation steps and milestones
- Integration points and dependencies
- Testing and validation criteria
